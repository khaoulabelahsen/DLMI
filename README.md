This repository contains the final year project for the Deep Learning for medical imaging class. 

We will participate in an open challenge on Kaggle called "Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation" (\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation/overview}) which took place in 2016 and allow us to submit our algorithms and compare them with the ones of other participants. The goal is to build a model which can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck. Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management catheter. The main related works for the problem are variants of U-Net.
